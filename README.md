# COVID-19 Regional Case Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data across U.S. states and counties. It includes:

Visualizing cumulative and daily new cases for a selected state.
Identifying peaks in daily cases using peak detection methods.


The analysis includes:

Visualizing cumulative and daily new cases.
Calculating the 7-day moving average of daily cases.
Analyzing growth rates of infections.
Detecting peaks in daily cases.
Comparing COVID-19 trends across multiple states.

Features
Cumulative Cases: Visualization of COVID-19 cases over time for specific states.
Daily New Cases: Calculation and bar chart visualization of daily new infections.
7-Day Moving Average: Smooth trends for better understanding of daily variations.
Growth Rate Analysis: Identify periods of rapid spread or stabilization.
Peak Detection: Highlight peaks in daily cases using signal processing.
State Comparisons: Compare COVID-19 trends across multiple states.
